## Installation

Install via your favorite package manager:

```vim
" If you are using Vim-Plug
Plug 'koraa/proverif.vim'
```

```lua
-- If you are using Packer
use 'koraa/proverif.vim'
```

## Alternatives

[smelc/proverif.vim](https://github.com/smelc/proverif.vim) served as the inspiration for this plugin. Compared to smelc's variant, this plugin:

- supports nested comments
- has theming support (through the standard highlight groups such as `Comment`, `Boolean`, etc.)
- supports a much wider set of syntax elements
- allows for installation through a package manager
- distinguishes between normal model operators/keywords (`Keyword` and `Operator` highlight groups) and query operators and keywords (`Special` highlight group)

[VincentCheval/language-proverif](https://github.com/VincentCheval/language-proverif) â€“ I would like to test this; it works through treesitter and I have treesitter installed, but I have no idea how to install this.


## Help wanted

**Thank you:** [smelc](https://github.com/smelc) (for providing inspiration for this plugin)

This plugin is very basic at the moment and I don't really know much about writing vim syntax files; if you have any improvements, please open a pull request!
